<p>Hello. My name is Ermani Moore. I was born in San Francisco, California on October 11, 2001<br>
  but moved to Castro Valley, California when I was one and have lived there since. Currently I am<br> 
  a junior at Castro Valley High School and hope to attend a college in Washington State one day.</p>


<h2>My Likes and Dislikes</h2>
<p>I am known for having a very pessimistic attitude so my list of dislikes is very long. I<br> 
  will however shorten it for the sake of fitting it on this page.</p>
