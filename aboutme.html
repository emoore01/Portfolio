  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/67645f913139bd1639489b168f80cee9/tumblr_inline_o0csblOiDG1slrvm0_500.jpg" />
<p> Hello. My name is Ermani Moore. I was born in San Francisco, California on October 11, 2001
  but moved to Castro Valley, California when I was one and have lived there since. Currently I am 
  a junior at Castro Valley High School and hope to survive the next 10 months of my life with only
  a few mental breakdowns.</p>


<h2>My Likes and Dislikes</h2>
<p>I am known for having a very pessimistic attitude so my list of dislikes is very long. I<br> 
  will however shorten it for the sake of fitting it on this page.</p>
