<p>I always tought robots had to be capable of an independent action but now I know it just has to be programmed.</p>

<p>I'm excited to start getting the robot to perform actions.</p>

<p>Working separately and then coming together to share ideas for the scavenger hunt worked well.</p>

<p>I could try to contribute more ideas and be more helpful... I guess...</p>
