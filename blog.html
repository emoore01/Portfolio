<p>I always tought robots had to be capable of an independent action but now I know it just has to be programmed.</p>

<p>I'm excited to start getting the robot to perform actions.</p>

<p>Working separately and then coming together to share ideas for the scavenger hunt worked well.</p>

<p>I could try to contribute more ideas and be more helpful... I guess...</p>
  
  
  <p>GWC Robot Week Day 3 7/12/2017</p>
  <p>Both women work on robots designed to help humans.</p>
  <p>Our team worked quite well. Two of us began coding after our psudocode time while the other two continued thinking of the code.<br>
    This made us more productive overall.</p>
  <p>The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are ??? I don't know what an Arduino sketch is... I assume the wires, LED lights, and <br>
    resistors. Or maybe the viod setup and void loop.
